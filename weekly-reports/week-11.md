Week 11
=======

There's really not much to report. The design is operational. At this point, 
I want to:

  * Get it soldered onto a protoboard.
  * Clean up the perl script and have it load as a service, at least, if 
I can't figure out how to make it a kernel module.
  * Populate the research journal in /research/ with everything from these 
weekly status reports.
  * Write a summary paper, summarizing all of the literature out there.
  * Expand the CDR presentation into the Senior Design Project Day 
presentation. Be sure to touch on debiasing vs decorrelating --debias gets 
rid of bias, decorrelate gets rid of correlation-- and how you don't want 
either in your bitstream. Provide background info about noise types and the 
characteristics of avalanche breakdown noise in-particular. Just found a 
good source about this, but it's buryed in my bookmarks folder right now and 
it's 4am and I'm tired and I'm going to bed. Like now.

Side note: I FINALLY learned about why the noise sometimes showed up and 
sometimes didn't. Apparently it's got something to do with noise gathered 
from avalanche breakdown in particular. I didn't get all of it, but I'll 
probably go back at some point and get it under my belt.

In other news, not much has gotten done. I'm panicking, trying to get 
employed so I can pay back my student loans, and it's looking like I might 
actually have a shot with an employer. I've got a technical interview lined 
up on Friday morning and need to prep for it.
