Week 3:

The goal of week 3 is to resolve the signal integrity issue. Initial probing 
with the scope shows that indeed, the comparator is the problem. Signal 
looks good up until it enters the comparator. 

As of Tuesday February 04 2014 at 1531 CST, I have yet to rewire the 
comparator. This is scheduled for later tonight. Once rewired, I should be 
getting a functional bitstream that passes initial tests. Don't know if I'll 
get to that tonight or not though.
