The comparator was definitely wired wrong. Now that it is correctly wired --
well, I think it is-- I am getting more bits! They even appear random at 
first glance, though there is still a bunch of '.' characters that I suspect 
are thanks to the delay on the arduino code. Going to see how things go if I 
remove that delay.
