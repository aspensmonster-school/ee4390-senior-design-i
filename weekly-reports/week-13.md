Well, the weekend came and went. I managed to knock out the 
4-bit ALU for my VHDL class at least. I'm working on getting a 
full-coverage test suite up and running. The complicated modules 
(add/sub and shift_rotate) are already confirmed to work 
perfectly. However, testing the comparator requires some more 
work.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Here's what I'm up against:

  * Labs in VHDL
  * Term paper/presentation in VHDL
  * Exam this thursday (April 17 2014) in ethics.
  * Final project in DSP.
  * Term paper in Software Engineering.
  * Senior design presentation and final paper

And of course finals. And it all has to be done in the 
coming two weeks.

I really want to put all of my efforts into a strong 
summary paper of hardware RNGs and randomness in general. 
But I also can't afford to fail --technically, can't get less 
than a C-- any of my courses. This is my last semester of 
financial aid and I don't want to think of what I'd have to 
say and do if everyone who's showing up for my graduation 
gets to instead hear that actually, Preston isn't graduating.
I've heard there are at least a few folks who've taken wagers 
that I'd never graduate. And I'd like to make sure they are 
proven wrong.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm currently debating whether I should remain awake all night. 
I'm already pretty turned around, having not woken up this 
past Sunday until 1600. I'm think I will. I'll knock out the 
rest of the labs in VHDL (they aren't as difficult), and try 
to scribble something passable for the term paper in VHDL.

And then I'll drive to San Marcos with my prototype and get some 
FFT readings on the noise source.
