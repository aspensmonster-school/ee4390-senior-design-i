Week 2 is almost over, and I still have yet to do squat. Maybe I'll look 
into writing up some perl code to interface with the arduino so I don't have 
to rely on the IDE that it comes with.

UPDATE:

I've got the perl code and modified arduino code written. Both compile. Onto 
testing.

UPDATE2:

I've now got Perl reading the arduino serial directly and the arduino 
doing digitalreads and spitting them out in byte-sized chunks. Calling it a 
night. Still don't have the RNG operating properly though.
