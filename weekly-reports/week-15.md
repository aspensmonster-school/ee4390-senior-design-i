==================================

This is the end.

I've got all the material I need for the lightening talk. I never got
around to soldering a new prototype on protoboard. Every noise source
is different. I'd have to recollect a bunch of data. I already have good data
that demonstrates the various problems I ran into over time.

I should have the presentation up by the end of the weekend. At this point,
I'm just hoping I haven't forgotten anything.
