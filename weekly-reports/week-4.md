Going to fiddle around with just a comparator to make sure I'm not making
some really stupid mistake in understanding how it works. Possible other
problem: What is the input impedance on a digital port of the Arudino Uno?
Perhaps the signal is just sticking on the output of the comparator rather
than hopping over to the arduino digitial IO port. Hmm... I'll keep that in
mind. 
 
In other news... 
 
I got one of these:

I might try to use it when I parallelize the RNG implementation. Would also 
give me more experience with HDLs and HVLs (and of course FPGAs).
