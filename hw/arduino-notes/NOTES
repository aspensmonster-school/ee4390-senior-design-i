The RNG is spitting out bits now that I've got the comparator ``working.'' 
I can send this data to the arduino on a digital port, and the arduino then 
sends data over serial to the host. Once initialized by running minicom to 
connect to the arduino (and then leave) I am able to `cat /dev/ttyACM0` and 
get a stream of ones and zeros. Not yet up to scratch on testing them 
however.
