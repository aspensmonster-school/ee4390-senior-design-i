%% stripped down version of "bare_jrnl.tex" for use in EE3370. 
%% Original version has very good comments for use. You should check it out at
%% http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/authors/authors_journals.html
%% I run GNU/Linux so I downloaded the "Unix LaTeX2e Transactions Style File"
%% package and based my work off of the sample tex file named "bare_jrnl.tex".
