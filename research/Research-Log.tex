\section{Sunday September 15 2013}

Was able to get dieharder compiled and running. Can feed in both /dev/urandom 
and a binary file of random, unsigned, 32-bit int's generated from Perl's 
rand() function. While /dev/urandom is passing most tests --it is marked
WEAK in others-- it seems that generating even a million random ints is 
not sufficient for dieharder. It will generate output stating that it "rewound"
the file anywhere from tens of times to hundreds of times. Of course when 
it rewinds the file it is no longer "random" and so the tests fail. Good to 
know.

As well, it is becoming apparent that I will need to develop a rigourous 
statistical understanding of randomness. I should also familiarize myself with 
the GNU Scientific Library, as dieharder integrates tightly with it.

Regardless, I have the RNG stress-tester up and running. Now I need to focus 
on perhaps making a randomness bitstream a la /dev/customRandom, as our 
RNG will ultimately be speaking over a serial line and into the host that 
will then put the raw bits here.

\section{Thursday September 19 2013}

Found an outstanding link on random noise generation using avalanche 
breakdown. He even utilized ngspice in the simulation process! This should 
prove to be an outstanding guidepost. Judging by his work, there's a good 
chance that avalanche noise might be the best source to work with if 
construction by hand is a requirement.

Still reading. It looks like he's covered all the fundamental bases I wanted 
to cover. If his work proves to speed up mine considerably, I should 
consider investigating parallelizing these designs and having a 
microcontroller for de-skewing and de-biasing this semester, rather than 
second semester.
