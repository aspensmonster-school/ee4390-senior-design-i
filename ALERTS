=================

All parts are in to begin prototyping the RNG proposed by Vazanna. Will begin
prototyping later today and ideally have oscope pictures and preliminary 
dieharder test suite results if the RNG->Arduino->Host dependencies can get 
squared away. Infomaniac50's work should help with teh Arduino->Host aspect.

================

Who am I kidding. October flew by with hardly any work getting done. The 
other four courses have been eating up all my time. However, I'm doing well 
in them and plan on shifting gears for a little bit. I can afford to let 
a few things slide. But really, I need to get a physical prototype up and 
running ASAP. I've been running through simulations, and thought of a 
rather interesting chicken and egg issue:

If I'm building a hardware RNG, then how can I trust any simulation designed 
to test such an RNG without having a hardware RNG providing the noise to 
the simulator? How does the simulator handle noise at all? Going to add 
this to the research log. I think this is a good example of how simulation 
only goes so far.
