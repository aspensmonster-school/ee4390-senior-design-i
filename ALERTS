=================

All parts are in to begin prototyping the RNG proposed by Vazanna. Will begin
prototyping later today and ideally have oscope pictures and preliminary 
dieharder test suite results if the RNG->Arduino->Host dependencies can get 
squared away. Infomaniac50's work should help with teh Arduino->Host aspect.
