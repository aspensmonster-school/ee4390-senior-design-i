== Dieharder ==

I don't currently know of a good way of "bundling" dieharder or otherwise 
testing for/expecting it in the host enivironment. For now, I am going to 
include the source tarball releases in my repo and build them locally 
for testing.

$ tar -xzvf dieharder-3.31.1.tgz
$ cd dieharder-3.31.1
$ libtoolize -f
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make

The build system seems at least a little wonky. I have to `libtoolize -f` 
in order for `make` to succeed. I'm not yet familiar enough with the GNU
autotools to tell you what's wrong with the configure.ac or Makefile.am 
input files.

Regardless, the software should build and then leave a functional `dieharder`
binary in the dieharder folder.
