Presentation:

* Title (Maness, 1.4, Hardware RNG)
* Motivation (Snowden Revelations, PRNG compromise)
* Why (Familiarize myself with one aspect of modern cryptographic systems)
* Highlight that this has been done before. A lot. Emphasize that scientific 
  method is applied copiously in order to verify the previous work.
* General: The RNG outputs random bits to an arduino which then pushes the bits
  to a host machine that analyzes them for their randomness.
* Slide on Hardware Stack (BJT->OpAmps->Comparator->Arduino->Host).
* Slide on Software Stack (Arduino, Linux, Perl, ngspice/gschem).
* Deliverables (Prototype, testing harness all hooked up).
* Timeline (See README in root of repo).
* Status: Prototype functional. Sending bits to host. Preliminary tests 
  indicate the bitstream is random.
* Next Semester: Parallelize with multiple different sources. High-Speed 
  sampling. On-chip verification of randomness.
